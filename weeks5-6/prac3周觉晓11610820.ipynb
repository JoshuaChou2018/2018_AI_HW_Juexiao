Intuitively, the choices made by each player in the deterministic trees are based on full knowledge of future dice rolls, and bear no necessary relationship to the moves made without such knowledge. (Notice the connection to the discussion of card games in Section 5.6.2 and to the general problem of fully and partially observable Markov decision problems in Chapter 17.) In prac- tice, the method works reasonably well, and it might be a good exercise to have students compare it to the alternative of using expectiminimax with sampling (rather than summing over) dice rolls."
